# Desert Swarm: Game Design Document

## Vision Statement
We envision a 2D top-down horde shooter where the player will have to fight against waves of enemies to survive as long as possible. The player will have to move and fight for their survival to delay the oncoming doom. 

## Gameplay 
The player will start with a pistol against the bug horde. The bugs will approach the player as well as shoot projectiles at the player. The player will be able to receive better weapons the longer they survive. The bugs will increase in number and speed until the player is overwhelmed. 

### Mechanics
The player can move as well as 360 aiming with the weapons of the character. The different weapons have different features that ensure dynamic functionality and keep up with the mob spawn rate. 

### Scoring and/or Win / Lose Conditions
Players will be scored based on survival time. The longer the player survives, the higher their score will be. The player will lose when a bug lands hits on the player and overwhelms them. 

### Controls
WSAD controls will move the player. The mouse will be used for aiming. Left click will be used to fire the gun. 

### Aesthetic
A gloomy mob shooter where a trooper navigates a bug-infested world. 

### Desired Player Experience
The player should start the round calm, but will end the round feeling overwhelmed. 

## Game Characters
The player is a desert soldier, and the attacking mobs are a wide variety of insects (TBD)

## Story
The soldier is lost and finds himself surrounded by a swarm of insects. He will fight to survive for as long as possible. 

## The Game World
The map consists of a desert environment with sand, cactus, and dried weeds.
